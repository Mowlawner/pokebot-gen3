**PokéBot Gen3** is a shiny hunting bot, written in Python that runs `libmgba` + mGBA Python bindings under the hood. Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed and LeafGreen are supported. 

Initially created to complete a Prof. Oak and Living ✨Shiny✨ Dex Challenge in Pokémon Emerald, a 24/7 livestream of the challenge can be found ongoing [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQWyyI7JmTk).

# ❓ Getting Started

Visit the [wiki](wiki/Readme.md) for information:
- ❓ [Getting Started](wiki/pages/Getting%20Started.md)

- 🔎 [Pokémon by Bot Mode](wiki/pages/Pokemon%20By%20Bot%20Mode.md)

For development and reproduction, `--stutter-trace` writes opt-in rolling
frame traces to the selected profile. Use `--stutter-threshold-ms` to adjust
the frame-duration trigger. `--no-save-state` leaves the emulator's retained
state unchanged when the bot exits; this is useful when reproducing a stateful
runtime issue or running a regression check against the current emulator state.

# ✨ Preamble

You are welcome to use or stream the bot in any way you want, including streaming your own 24/7 Prof. Oak challenge streams.

The intent of this bot is not to _cheat_ for shinies or complete the game as fast as possible, but instead to transform generation 3 Pokémon games into somewhat of an idle game, stacking up millions of encounters searching for that one encounter, or completing an absurd challenge.

The bot is frame perfect and can _technically_ cheat by reading data from any point in memory and manipulating RNG. By default, it will attempt to perform actions as if a human were playing to make gameplay as representative as possible, some examples:
- Starter Pokémon are generated just _1 frame_ after confirming the starter selection, the bot will wait until the battle begins, and the starter Pokémon sprite is visible before soft resetting
- It's possible to peek inside un-hatched eggs to view stats and shininess as soon as they're received from the daycare, the bot will wait until the eggs are fully hatched before checking and logging
- Feebas tile locations _could_ be instantly located by reading memory, instead, the bot will attempt to locate the tiles by searching each tile individually
